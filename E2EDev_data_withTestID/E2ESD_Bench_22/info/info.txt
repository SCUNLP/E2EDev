Based on the provided HTML and JavaScript code of the voting application, I have inferred the user requirements, the involved modules, and their functionalities. Below is the autogenerated JSON file that captures all user requirements, associated modules, and comprehensive test cases to validate the functionalities.

### Explanation:
- **Modules** section describes the key parts of the application: Voting, Results, and Voting Logic, indicating their functionalities and type.
- **User Requirements** reflect what users expect to be able to do, such as voting, viewing results, and resetting votes, along with detailed test cases for each requirement.
- **Test Cases** illustrate how to verify that each user requirement works correctly, covering various user actions, edge cases, error handling, and valid responses from the user interface.
