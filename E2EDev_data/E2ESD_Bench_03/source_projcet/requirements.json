        "overview": "The Movie Seat Booking application allows users to select a movie and book seats in a theater. Users can choose from a list of movies, select available seats, and view the total cost of their selections. The application retains user selections using local storage to persist data across sessions.",
        "predefined_options": "The application offers a set of predefined movie options, each associated with a specific ticket price and uniquely identifiable by its corresponding data-testid. The default selection is 'The Big Lebowski' priced at $10 (data-testid='movie-option-1'), followed by 'Fargo' at $12 (data-testid='movie-option-2'), 'O Brother' at $8 (data-testid='movie-option-3'), and 'No Country for Old Men' at $9 (data-testid='movie-option-4'). The theater seating is arranged in 6 rows, with each row containing 8 seats. Every seat is uniquely identifiable via a data-testid in the format seat-row-column. For example, seat-1-1 refers to the first seat in the first row, and seat-2-3 refers to the third seat in the second row. Initially, the following seats are marked as occupied: Row 2: Seat 4 (seat-2-4) and Seat 5 (seat-2-5); Row 3: Seat 7 (seat-3-7) and Seat 8 (seat-3-8); Row 5: Seat 4 (seat-5-4) and Seat 5 (seat-5-5); Row 6: Seat 5 (seat-6-5), Seat 6 (seat-6-6), and Seat 7 (seat-6-7). This configuration ensures that each seat and movie option can be distinctly identified and interacted with, facilitating robust and precise testing.",
