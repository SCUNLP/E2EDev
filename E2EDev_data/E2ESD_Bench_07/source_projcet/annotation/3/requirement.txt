The web application must enable users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their height and weight inputs using the formula BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) * height (m)). The result must be rounded to two decimal places and displayed in the result area identified by data-testid "result-display" in the format "Your BMI is <calculated_value>". The implementation must support normal and edge scenarios, including valid numeric input, minimum non-zero values (e.g., weight = 1, height = 0.01 resulting in "Your BMI is 10000.00"), and maximum reasonable values (e.g., weight = 635, height = 2.72 resulting in "Your BMI is 85.89"). It must also handle error conditions gracefully: if either height or weight input is non-numeric, such as "xyz", or left empty, the result must be "NaN". The interface must use the specified data-testid attributes: "weight-input" for the weight field, "calculate-button" for the trigger button, and "result-display" for the output, and must ensure consistent behavior across all cases.
