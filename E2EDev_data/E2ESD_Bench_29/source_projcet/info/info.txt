Based on the provided HTML and JavaScript code for the Modern Expense Tracker application, we can infer the user requirements, the involved modules, and their functionalities. We will also formulate comprehensive test cases catering to different user actions, edge cases, error handling, and flow paths.

Here's the generated JSON file for the task:
