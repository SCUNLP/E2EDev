### Explanation of the JSON Structure:
- **task_id**: Unique identifier for the task (quiz app).
- **task_name**: General name of the task.
- **task_description**: Brief description of what the application does.
- **modules**: An array of objects describing each module's ID, name, description, and type (frontend in this case).
- **user_requirement_list**: Details each user requirement along with associated test cases for validating the functionality:
  - Each user requirement contains test cases that outline the steps, expected results, and involved modules. This ensures thorough testing of the conditions, user journeys, and error handling scenarios. 

This JSON structure effectively captures the requirements, functionality, and testing strategies necessary for the quiz application.
