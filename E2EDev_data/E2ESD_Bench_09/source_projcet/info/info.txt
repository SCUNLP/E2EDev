Based on the provided HTML and JavaScript code for the "Study Planner" web application, we can infer the user requirements, involved modules, and their functionalities as follows:

### User Requirements and Functions
1. Users should be able to create a schedule by entering a subject, date, and time.
2. Users should be able to add tasks with a specified deadline.
3. The application should display the created schedules and tasks.

### Modules Involved
1. **Module 1**: Schedule Management
   - **Description**: Handles the creation and display of schedules.
   - **Type**: Frontend

2. **Module 2**: Task Management
   - **Description**: Manages tasks and deadlines.
   - **Type**: Frontend

### JSON Structure
Following the insights derived from the code, we can now construct the JSON file as per the required format:

### Explanation of Sections
- The `task_id`, `task_name`, and `task_description` provide context about the application.
- The `modules` array outlines the components that make up the application.
- Each `user_requirement` lays out specific features with detailed `test_cases` that include steps for verification and expected outcomes.

This JSON structure covers a variety of scenarios including valid submissions, necessary validations, edge cases, and provides a framework for potential automated testing of the application.
