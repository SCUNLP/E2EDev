In this JSON structure, we have identified two main modules: the Text Reader Interface and the Speech Synthesis functionality. The user requirements focus on displaying the interface, reading text aloud, and allowing the user to select voices. Corresponding test cases for each requirement cover various user actions, edge cases, and expected outcomes.
