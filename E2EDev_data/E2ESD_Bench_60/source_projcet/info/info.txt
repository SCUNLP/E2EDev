Based on the provided HTML and JavaScript code of the web application, the following analysis reveals the user requirements, involved modules, and the functionality of each module. We'll structure this information into a JSON file format as specified.

### Analysis:

1. **User Requirements**:
   - The user must be able to select two different currencies from dropdown lists.
   - The user must be able to input an amount in one of the currencies.
   - The user will receive the exchange rate between the selected currencies and the converted amount.
   - The user can swap the currencies to convert in the opposite direction.

2. **Modules**:
   - **Frontend Module**: This includes all HTML elements and client-side JavaScript.
     - **Functionality**: UI elements for currency selection, amount input, rate display, and currency swapping.
