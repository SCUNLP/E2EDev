### Explanation:
- The `task` and its details are defined at the top level.
- Each module is represented with its ID, name, description, and type.
- User requirements are listed, each containing a set of associated test cases.
- Each test case describes what it validates, the steps to execute it, expected results, and the modules involved in that test case. 

This JSON structure will assist developers in managing user requirements and testing their functionalities effectively.
