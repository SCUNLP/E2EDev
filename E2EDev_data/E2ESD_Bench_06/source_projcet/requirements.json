    "overview": "The Playable Piano web application allows users to interact with a virtual piano. Users can click on piano keys or press corresponding keyboard keys to play notes. The application includes features for adjusting volume and toggling the visibility of key labels.",
    "predefined_options": "The web application initializes with a default volume level set to 0.5, and piano key labels are displayed by default upon launch. It features a virtual piano with both black and white keys, each mapped to specific keyboard characters. The black keys correspond to the uppercase letters W, E, T, Y, U, O, and P, while the white keys correspond to A, S, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, and ;. Each key element in the DOM is assigned a unique data-test-id attribute in the format data-test-id=\"piano-key-'x'\", where 'x' is the lowercase version of the corresponding keyboard character (e.g., the key for W uses data-test-id=\"piano-key-'w'\").",
    "external_resources": "The corresponding audio files for each piano note are stored in the tunes directory, with filenames matching the lowercase key characters followed by .wav, such as tunes/a.wav, tunes/;.wav, tunes/d.wav, tunes/e.wav, and so on, covering all relevant keys including w, e, t, y, u, o, p, a, s, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, and ;.",
    "external_js_libraries": "No external JavaScript libraries are used in this application."
