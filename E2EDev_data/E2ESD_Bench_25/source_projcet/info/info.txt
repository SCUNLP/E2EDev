Based on the provided HTML and JavaScript code for the web application that allows users to double-click an image to "like" it (represented visually by displaying hearts), we can infer the user requirements, the modules involved, and the functionality of those modules.

### Inferred User Requirements and Modules

1. **User Requirements**
   - Users should be able to double-click on an area to create a heart icon.
   - Users should be able to see a count of how many times they have liked (double-clicked) the area.
   - The heart icon should appear where the user clicks and disappear after a short period.
   - The application should handle rapid double-clicks smoothly without errors.

2. **Modules Involved**
   - **Frontend Module:** Responsible for the user interface, including HTML elements and styles.
   - **JavaScript Module:** Responsible for the interaction and behavior, handling user events and dynamic updates to the HTML.
