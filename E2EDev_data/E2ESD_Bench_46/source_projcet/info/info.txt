Based on the provided HTML and JavaScript code for the "Week Day Predictor App," we can infer the user requirements, identify modules, and formulate test cases. Below is the structured JSON output reflecting these aspects:

### Explanation:
1. **Modules**: Identified two modules for the application. The "Week Day Display" retrieves the system date and displays it, while the "Quotes Generator" generates the corresponding quote.
2. **User Requirements**: Three user requirements were defined based on functionality:
   - Displaying the current day.
   - Displaying the corresponding quote.
   - Validating the user interface.
3. **Test Cases**: Each user requirement has associated test cases that cover:
   - Normal and edge case scenarios for displaying the day and quote.
   - Responsive design checks.
   - Error handling for incorrect or unexpected input.
