### Explanation of the JSON Structure:
- **task_id, task_name, task_description**: These fields encapsulate the task's identity and purpose.
- **modules**: Each module involved in the application is detailed in terms of its functionalities and type.
- **user_requirement_list**: This list contains the specific user requirements derived from the functionality of the application.
- **test_cases**: Each user requirement is associated with one or more test cases that cover various aspects such as normal operations, error handling, and edge cases. Each test case outlines the steps to reproduce the scenario, what is expected, and which modules are affected. 

With this structure, testing coverage can be ensured, and it can serve as a foundation for further development and validation of the application.
