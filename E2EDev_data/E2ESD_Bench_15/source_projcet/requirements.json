    "overview": "This web application is a custom video player that allows users to play, pause, skip, adjust volume, change playback speed, seek using a progress bar, and toggle fullscreen mode. The interface is designed to provide intuitive controls for video playback.",
    "predefined_options": "Predefined options include default values for volume (1.0), playback rate (1.0), and progress bar starting at 0%. Skip buttons are preset to skip -10 seconds backward and 25 seconds forward. Structurally, the player consists of a container element (.player) that wraps both the video playback area and the control interface, and a video element (.player__video.viewer) where the actual playback occurs.",
